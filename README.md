# PH-Assignment-1

Programming Hero 1st Assignment. The site design was provided by PH through (png, pdf and figma file)and I developed the site from scratch. I used pure HTML and CSS only to build the site.

Â© All resources (images, contents, shapes) used in this project are for educational purposes only, none of these are for commerical usages. Programming Hero provided the resources for images and shapes. And the contents are collected from the web (various articles). The real authors and companies preserve the right of their own contents.
